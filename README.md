# BAREclaw

One daemon, many mouths, one brain. The bare minimum between you and your AI.

A thin daemon that lets you talk to Claude Code from anywhere -- SMS, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Apple Watch, Shortcuts, curl. Every input channel funnels into `claude -p` on your machine. Full session context, tools, skills, MCP servers, CLAUDE.md. Responses come back out the same way they came in.

See `docs/RESEARCH.md` for the full design document.
