# Product Guidelines

## Voice and Tone

Concise and direct. No fluff, no filler. Say what needs to be said and stop.

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity over features** — Minimal surface area. Every addition must justify its existence. Prefer deleting code to adding it.
2. **Developer experience focused** — Easy to set up, extend, and debug. A new adapter should be obvious to write.
3. **Reliability** — Sessions survive everything except intent. Crashes, restarts, reconnections — the session persists.

## Standards

- Action-oriented documentation — show what to do, not what could be done.
- Phone-screen-friendly output — short messages, no walls of text.
- Security is the user's responsibility, with guard rails provided.
